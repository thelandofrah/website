## About this release

Recorded live @ Greenhouse Studios February 25'. 

Featuring Hinano Fujisaki on Sax, Siki on a piano from 1910 germany (!), Betty on vocals, Luke Saunders on bowed baritone guitar + guitar & vocals. 

Written over the course of a breakup, the performance & recording of this album was a cathartic experience to say the least.
