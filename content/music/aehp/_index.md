## About this release

Dragon steals pumpkin with the soul of an innocent boy bound to it. Father of the boy rallies a noble gang of local villagers to get the pumpkin back. They meet a kangaroo priest who tells them they must assemble a fractured ancient sword in order to kill this dragon. Each part of the sword held by a witch or wizard, most of whom are evil or at least fucked. We were 19 when we made this.
