## About this release

18 tracks, 1 hour and 13 minutes. 22 musicians & 18 visual artists

Set by the sea, while lost & wandering through the desert of my mind. An album about going through the motions waiting for something that might never come. A meditation on love, loss & patience. 

Who is the captain? & why are we waiting for them? 

The captain is who or whatever you want it to be. A general way to take it is someone or something you’re waiting for to tell you how to live your life… 

From the get go I always wanted this album to be ambiguous, a long winding sonic journey with a vague mirage of narrative painted by the lyrics. Leaving room for the listeners imagination and personal experiences to intertwine with the themes & take everyone to their own place. 

This approach allowed a really organic growth for the album and even though all the songs are scattered throughout the lore of Rah & the vocals are (mostly) not mine, this album has ended up feeling much more personal to me this time. As the dots joined, I would write songs to bridge together two different musical moods, and subconsciously reconcile dissonant emotions in my brain. Listening back to it was a wild reflective journey. 

I wrote a 3 page document about what it all means to me, how it paints a whimsical diary entry of my life over the last 4 years…

But in the end I’ve decided not to share that, because I want it to take you on your own journey. 

I hope you enjoy.
