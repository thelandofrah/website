notes = """“From Where You Sleep” is an exploration of proximity, perception, and presence.
This black and white double exposure series was created within strict radiuses of 2, 5 and 10m
from where the artist slept, each completed within a focused 2-hour window.

Using texture, art, and fragments of the everyday, the work observes what stories emerge
when we truly use our ambience — what we overlook, what we carry, and what surrounds us
in the places we call home."""
