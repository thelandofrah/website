Welcome to the board. This space is for questions, tips, event chatter, and feedback.

### How to post

1. Create a new file in `content/community/` named with your topic, e.g. `my-question.md`.  
2. Add frontmatter with `title`, `description`, `date`, and optional `tags` + `comments`.  
3. Write your post body in markdown below the frontmatter.

### Tips

- Include links to any reference images or sets.  
- Tag your post so it’s easy to find via search.  
- Keep replies on-topic; add a new post for new topics.  

If you hit bugs, add a post with the tag `bug`.
